# lain

A Wikipedia interface styled after Serial Experiments Lain's cyberpunk aesthetic.

## Features

- **Copland OS boot sequence**: Authentic startup animation referencing Tachibana Labs and the Navi
- **Animated data stream background**: Falling glyphs (katakana, binary, kanji) reminiscent of the Wired
- **Typing quote rotation**: Lain quotes appear with a typewriter effect and cycle automatically
- **Protocol status bar**: Live clock, connection indicator, and layer tracking
- **Layer cycling**: Each search advances through the 13 episode layers (WEIRD, GIRLS, PSYCHE, etc.)
- **Navi-inspired UI frame**: Corner brackets and side data ticker evoke the Navi interface
- **CRT effects**: Scanlines, vignette, screen flicker, and a sweeping glitch bar
- **Chromatic aberration glitch**: Title text splits into red/cyan channels during glitch animation
- **Wikipedia search integration**: Real-time search using Wikipedia's API
- **Responsive layout**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Usage

2. Enter your search query in the search box
3. Press Enter or click the SEARCH button
4. Browse Wikipedia articles in the signature Lain style
